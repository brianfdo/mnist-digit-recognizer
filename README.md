# mnist_digit_recognizer

This repository currently contains two types of solutions that can classify a numeric value to a handwritten digit.

On my first attempt to classify each handwritten number in the dataset, I used a simple K-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm.
Since the handwritten numbers represent values from 0 to 9, the KNN model assigns a class for each numeric value. By training the model using training data, the algorithm was able to create classes for each numeric value and assign data to the class that had the nearest neighbors. From this method I achieved an accuracy of 96.603% by comparing the model's predictions to the actual values.

I wanted my first attempt to be the benchmark, therefore, I was keen to improve to get the highest accuracy as possible.
